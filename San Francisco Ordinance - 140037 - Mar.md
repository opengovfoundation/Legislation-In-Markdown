Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: 	
Section 1.  Findings.
  
 * (a) The supply of housing in the City and County of San Francisco is one of the oldest in on the West Coast.   A majority of the City&rsquo;s rental housing is over sixty years old and public resources to support renovation and code upgrades privately owned housing is insufficient to address the long term need.   The City&rsquo;s aging housing stock, its relative density compared to other cities, and the risk of significant seismic event create a clear and compelling public interest in assuring that the City maximizes opportunities to upgrade housing to contemporary standards for fire prevention and life safety, including seismic strengthening.   

 * (b) The City and County of San Francisco has adopted a comprehensive program of regulations to assure that rental housing converted to individual ownership as condominiums meet housing, building, and fire code standards prior to their conversion and sale as condominiums.   Those regulations also addresses additional concerns to minimize displacement of existing residents and to assure the public notice and review of applications for conversion.     

 * (c) In recent years, the real estate industry and certain financial institutions have developed instruments and private contracts that create saleable interests in individual apartment units, including fractionalized loans, that are marketed to mimic condominiums  but are not subject to the stringent consumer protection, public notice and review, and health/life safety controls placed on condominium conversions.  Such units, a specialized form of Tenancies in Common (TICs) and herein described as &ldquo;Fractionalized Ownership Units,&rdquo; are often sold to the public at prices approaching those prices of condominiums but without the code upgrades that would enable the units to endure a major seismic event or other major natural disaster. 

 * (d) At present, the City and County of San Francisco has no mechanism to measure or track the number or location of apartment units converted to &ldquo;Fractionalized Ownership Units.&rdquo;  It is reported that many converted units are ultimately used only for nonresidential tourist or corporate use with adverse impacts on neighborhood cohesiveness and character.  Requiring developers to apply for and report upon the conversion of apartments to Fractionalized Ownership Units would enable the City to monitor and regulate future nonresidential uses.  

 * (e) Furthermore, many Fractionalized Ownership Unit purchasers cannot afford to retrofit and/or upgrade because of the burden of  purchasing their unit at today&rsquo;s record prices for such housing.  This places owners at financial and physical risk and reduces the resiliency of San Francisco's neighborhoods in event of catastrophes.  

 * (f) The current lack of regulation over Fractionalized Ownership Units's also forgoes San Francisco's last best chance to upgrade neighborhoods&rsquo; housing stock while simultaneously preserving their physical form/character. 

 * Section 2.  The San Francisco Planning Code is hereby amended by amending Sections 102, 311, and 312 to read as follows: 
  * SEC. 102.18.  ONE OWNERSHIP. 
 * Ownership of a parcel or contiguous parcels of property or possession thereof under a contract to purchase by a person or persons, firm, corporation or partnership, individually, jointly, in common, or in any other manner whereby such property is under single or unified control. The term shall include condominium ownership. The term "owner" shall mean the person, firm, corporation or partnership exercising one ownership as herein defined. 
(Amended by Ord. 443-78, App. 10/6/78; Ord. 412-88, App. 9/10/88; Ord. 115-90, App. 4/6/90) 
 * <u>SEC. 102.37.  FRACTIONALIZED OWNERSHIP.</u> 
 * <u>Ownership of a building containing two or more dwelling units, or possession thereof under a written contract to purchase or transfer ownership, by persons, firms, companies, corporations or partnerships, where persons, firms, companies, corporations or partnerships have or may have 1) an  undivided  ownership interest in the property, and 2) by agreement have an exclusive right of occupancy to an individual dwelling unit, and 3) where the dwelling unit have not been mapped as a condominium, community apartment or stock cooperative per Article 9 of the Subdivision Code.</u>
