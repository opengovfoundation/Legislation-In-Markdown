FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY

**Case No. 2014-0101-A**
#<u>OPINION AND ORDER</u>
This matter comes before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) for Baltimore County as a Petition for Administrative Variance filed by the legal owners of the subject property, Vaibhav H. and Swati V. Mehta. The variance request is from Section 301.1.A of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (“B.C.Z.R.”), to permit a proposed open deck in the rear of the existing dwelling with a rear yard setback of 20 ft. in lieu of the required 22.5 ft. The subject property and requested relief are more particularly described on Petitioners’ Exhibit 1.
The Zoning Advisory Committee (ZAC) comments were received and are made part of the record of this case. A ZAC comment was received from the Bureau of Development Plans Review (DRP) indicating that the proposed deck addition shall be set back at least 1 ft. away from the drainage and utility easement, so that the footing is not within the easement.
The Petitioners having filed a Petition for Administrative Variance and the subject property having been posted on November 3, 2013, and there being no request for a public hearing, a decision shall be rendered based upon the documentation presented.
The Petitioners have filed the supporting affidavits as required by Section 32-3-303 of the Baltimore County Code. Based upon the information available, there is no evidence in the file to indicate that the requested variance would adversely affect the health, safety or general welfare of the public and should therefore be granted. In the opinion of the Administrative Law Judge, the information, photographs, and affidavits submitted provide sufficient facts that comply with the requirements of Section 307.1 of the B.C.Z.R. Furthermore, strict compliance with the B.C.Z.R. would result in practical difficulty and/or unreasonable hardship upon the Petitioners.
Pursuant to the posting of the property and the provisions of both the Baltimore County Code and the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, and for the reasons given above, the requested variance should be granted.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, by the Administrative Law Judge for Baltimore County, this 20th day of November, 2013 that a Variance from Section 301.1.A of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (“B.C.Z.R.”), to permit a proposed open deck in the rear of the existing dwelling with a rear yard setback of 20 ft. in lieu of the required 22.5 ft., be and is hereby GRANTED, subject to the following:
1. The Petitioners may apply for their appropriate permits and be granted same upon receipt of this Order; however, Petitioners are hereby made aware that proceeding at this time is at their own risk until such time as the 30 day appellate process from this Order has expired. If, for whatever reason, this Order is reversed, the Petitioners would be required to return, and be responsible for returning, said property to its original condition.
2. The Petitioners shall comply with the ZAC comment submitted by DRP, dated November 6, 2013; a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Any appeal of this decision must be made within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.
