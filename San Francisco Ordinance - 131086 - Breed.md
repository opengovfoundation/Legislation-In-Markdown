Section 1.  Findings. 
 * A. On June 25, 2013, Mercy Housing California (&ldquo;Applicant&rdquo;) filed entitlement applications with the Planning Department for the conversion of a vacant SRO building adjacent to St. Agnes Catholic Church at the northwest corner of Page Street and Masonic Avenue (Block 1223, Lot 004) to an affordable housing development containing up to sixteen  dwellings for low-income households and one manager&rsquo;s unit (&ldquo;Project&rdquo;). In order for the Project to proceed and be developed as contemplated by the Applicant, amendments to certain provisions of the Planning Code are required. 
 * B. At a duly noticed public hearing held on December 19, 2013, the Planning Commission found that the public necessity, convenience, and general welfare required the approval of the proposed Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments, and by Resolution No. 19054 recommended them for approval. The Planning  Commission found that the proposed Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments were, on balance, consistent with the City's General Plan, and with Planning Code Section 101.1(b). A copy of said Resolution is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File No. 131086 and is incorporated herein by reference.  
 * C. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Board of Supervisors finds that these Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments will serve the public necessity, convenience, and welfare for the reasons set forth in Planning Commission Resolution No. 19054.  
 * D. The Board of Supervisors finds that this ordinance is in conformity with the General Plan and the Priority Policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 for the reasons set forth in Planning Commission Resolution No. 19054, and hereby incorporates those reasons by reference. 
 * E. The Planning Department issued a Certificate of Determination of categorical exemption/exclusion from environmental review, finding that the Project is exempt from environmental review under the General Rule Exclusion (Section 15061(b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines). The Board of Supervisors hereby affirms this determination. Said determination is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File No. 131086 and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 * F. Since the Planning Department issued the Certificate of Exemption and approved a Conditional Use authorization for the Project (contingent on this ordinance being enacted), the Board finds that there have been no substantial changes to the Project that 
would require major revisions to the Certificate of Determination or result in new significant environmental impacts; no substantial changes in circumstances have occurred that would require major revisions to the Certificate of Determination or result in new significant environmental impacts that were not evaluated in the Certificate of Determination; no new information has become available that was not known and could not have been known at the time the Certificate of Determination was issued and that would result in new significant environmental effects.
