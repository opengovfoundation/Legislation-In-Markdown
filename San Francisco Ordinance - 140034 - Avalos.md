 * Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: 
 * Section 1.  Background.  The Geneva Car Barn and Powerhouse (&ldquo;Car Barn&rdquo;), designed and built in 1901 by the Reid brothers, originally served as a depot for both private railroads as well as the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni).  It is the last physical vestige of San Francisco&rsquo;s first electric railway and was designated a City Landmark in 1985 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.  The Car Barn, located at the corner of Geneva Avenue and San Jose Avenue, consists of two adjoining structures, an approximately 12,000 square foot two-story office building, and an approximately 4,000 square foot single-story car shed, known as the Powerhouse.  Muni used the building as office space until 1989 when it was heavily damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake.  The Car Barn has been vacant ever since.  
 
 * In 1998, the Car Barn was saved from a planned demolition through the efforts of a neighborhood citizens group, the Friends of the Geneva Car Barn and Powerhouse (&ldquo;Friends&rdquo;), formed to oppose the demolition of the Car Barn.  After the Municipal Transportation Agency (&ldquo;MTA&rdquo;) stabilized the Car Barn in 1999, the MTA transferred jurisdiction over the Car Barn to the Recreation and Park Department (&ldquo;RPD&rdquo;) to be used for recreational purposes and related uses consistent with the RPD&rsquo;s mission (Resolution 193-04). 
 * On March 13, 2007, the Board of Supervisors appropriated $1,044,490 for the repair and renovation of the Car Barn (Ordinance No. 61-07).  RPD, in partnership with the Friends, developed a plan for the renovation and adaptive reuse of the Car Barn.  The plan included a seismic upgrade, installation of modern utility systems, restoration of historic features, accessibility improvements, artist studios, event/exhibition space, a cafe, theater, community meeting room, student lounge, and retail spaces.  RPD allocated $838,000 of the 2000 General Obligation Bond toward the project.   
 * In 2009, as a result of the City&rsquo;s budget deficit, the $1,044,490 allocated to the Car Barn in Ordinance No. 61-07 was rescinded. 
 * In response to this loss of funds, the Friends initiated a design competition for pro bono architectural services for the renovation of the Car Barn.  Aidlin Darling Design (&ldquo;Aidlin&rdquo;) won the competition, and to date has donated services valued at $205,500.  These services include the completion of concept and schematic designs, renderings of the proposed project, as well as assistance in the City&rsquo;s attainment of State and federal historic preservation approvals.   
 * RPD used Aidlin&rsquo;s schematic design to seek California Environmental Quality Act (&ldquo;CEQA&rdquo;) approval as well as approvals from the State Office of Historic Preservation (&ldquo;SHPO&rdquo;) and the National Park Service (&ldquo;NPS&rdquo;).   
 * Section 2.  Rationale for Waiver of Competitive Solicitation Requirement.  RPD wishes to leverage the $838,000 in 2000 GO Bond funds available for the project to seek additional funds from the 2015 Historic Preservation and New Market Tax Credit program as well as the City&rsquo;s Community Opportunity Fund program.  To be eligible for these programs, the project must have final design and construction documents completed by the end of 2014.   
 * Section 6.40 of the Administrative Code requires Departments to procure outside temporary professional design or consultant services for public work projects greater than $100,000 through a competitive process.   
 * RPD desires to award a professional services contract to Aidlin for two reasons.  First, because a typical competitive procurement for architectural services for public works projects can take many months, a competitive solicitation process under Section 6.40 of the Administrative Code would likely impair the City&rsquo;s ability to seek 2015 Historic Preservation and New Market Tax Credits and Community Opportunity Fund money for the Car Barn project.  Second, RPD is concerned that if another architect is brought onto the project, not only would it be unusual for that new firm to complete design and construction documents based on Aidlin&rsquo;s schematic design, but inconsistencies or changes with the design of the Car Barn could jeopardize the approvals received from SHPO and the NPS. 
 * Section 3.  Waiver of Competitive Solicitation Requirement.  The Board of Supervisors hereby waives the competitive solicitation process requirement under Section 6.40 of the Administrative Code and authorizes the General Manager of the Recreation and Park Department to enter into a professional services agreement with Aidlin Darling Design in the amount of $838,000 for the limited purpose of completing the design and construction documents for the Geneva Car Barn and Powerhouse.  
 * Section 4.  Effective Date.  This ordinance shall become effective 30 days after enactment.  Enactment occurs when the Mayor signs the ordinance, the Mayor returns the 
ordinance unsigned or does not sign the ordinance within ten days of receiving it, or the Board of Supervisors overrides the Mayor&rsquo;s veto of the ordinance.
