	Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: 
 
 * Section 1. Findings.  
 * (a)  In 2008, the Board of Supervisors adopted the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan and related zoning, in part to refine the City&rsquo;s approach to PDR (production, distribution, and repair) uses and to preserve and encourage such uses in the southeastern neighborhoods of the City.  This legislative package is comprised of Ordinance Nos. 297-08, 298-08, and 299-08, copies of which are on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File Nos. 081152, 081153, and 081154 respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  Since the adoption of this Plan and its associated zoning, the City has determined that the continued 
establishment, evolution, and adaptation of these uses demands a more responsive set of zoning controls in the Planning Code. 
 * (b)  The amended zoning controls in this legislation attempt to satisfy the following goals:  (1) Make it easier to establish PDR as a principally permitted use; (2) Allow PDR uses to share accessory retail space; (3) Simplify the &ldquo;Integrated PDR&rdquo; (IPDR) controls; (4) Entice the development of PDR on underdeveloped parcels in PDR Districts; (5) Support creation of new PDR space in re-built non-conforming self-storage uses; (6) Make &ldquo;Small Enterprise Workspace&rdquo; (SEW) to be more attractive to build; (7) Remove the Design and Development Special Use District; and (8) Clean up the definition of PDR.    
 * (c)  The Planning Department has determined that the actions contemplated in this Ordinance comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (California Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.). The Board of Supervisors hereby affirms this determination.  A copy of said determination is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File No. _____ and incorporated herein by reference. 
 * (d)  Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Board finds that the proposed ordinance will serve the public necessity, convenience and welfare for the reasons set forth in Planning Commission Resolution No. _____, which reasons are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth. A copy of Planning Commission Resolution No. _______ is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File No. _____. 
 * (e)  At a duly noticed public hearing held on ___________, 2014, the Planning Commission in Resolution No. _____ found that the proposed Planning Code amendments contained in this ordinance are consistent with the City's General Plan and with the Priority Policies of Planning Code Section 101.1. The Commission recommended that the Board of Supervisors adopt the proposed Planning Code amendments. The Board finds that the proposed Planning Code amendments contained in this ordinance are consistent with the 
City's General Plan and with the Priority Policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 for the reasons set forth in said Resolution. 
 
 * Section 2.  The Planning Code is hereby amended by deleting Sections 175.8, 249.35B, 249.39, 413.7, 428A, revising Sections 181, 204.3, 226, 227, and 890.49, and adding Section 219.1, to read as follows: 
 * ***<s>SEC. 175.8.  SUNSET FOR INTEGRATED PDR USES.</s>*** 
  * *<s>Any Integrated PDR use (as defined in Sec. 890.49) permitted by this Code will require conditional use authorization five years after the effective date of Ordinance Number 298-08 in order to allow for greater scrutiny of Integrated PDR uses in light of the City's Enterprise Zone Payroll Tax Credit program. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors should consider revising this control to continue permitting Integrated PDR uses if data show that 25 percent of all employees in areas Integrated PDR uses are eligible for the City's Enterprise Zone Payroll Tax Credit.</s>* 
 * **SEC. 181.  NONCONFORMING USES: ENLARGEMENTS, ALTERATIONS AND RECONSTRUCTION.** 
 * (a)   A nonconforming use, and any structure occupied by such use, shall not be enlarged, intensified, extended, or moved to another location, with the exception of the construction of a mezzanine within a live/work unit and expansion of dwelling units in PDR Districts, unless the result will be elimination of the nonconforming use, except as provided in Paragraph (b)(3) and (i) below and Section 186.1 of this Code. A nonconforming use shall not be extended to occupy additional space in a structure, or additional land outside a structure, or space in another structure, or to displace any other use, except as provided in Sections 182 and 186.1 of this Code.  
 * (b)   A structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall not be constructed, reconstructed or altered, unless the result will be elimination of the nonconforming use, except 
as provided in Section 186.1 of this Code and in Subsections (a) above and (d), (e), (f) and (g) below, and except as follows: 
 * (1)   Ordinary maintenance and minor repairs shall be permitted where necessary to keep the structure in sound condition, as well as minor alterations, where such work is limited to replacement of existing materials with similar materials placed in a similar manner.  
 * (2)   Minor alterations shall be permitted where ordered by an appropriate public official to correct immediate hazards to health or safety, or to carry out newly enacted retroactive requirements essential to health or safety.  
 * (3)   Alterations otherwise allowed by this Code shall be permitted for any portion of the structure that will not thereafter be occupied by the nonconforming use, provided the nonconforming use is not enlarged, intensified, extended, or moved to another location.  
 * (4)   All other alterations of a structural nature shall be permitted only to the extent that the aggregate total cost of such other structural alterations, as estimated by the Department of Public Works, is less than &frac12; of the assessed valuation of the improvements prior to the first such alteration, except that structural alterations required to reinforce the structure to meet the standards for seismic loads and forces of the Building Code shall be permitted without regard to cost.  
 * (c)   A dwelling or other housing structure exceeding the permitted density of dwelling units or other housing units set forth in Sections 207.5, 208, 209.1, 209.2, or 215 of this Code for the district in which it is located shall be classified as a nonconforming use under Section 180 of this Code, but only to the extent that such dwelling or other housing structure exceeds the permitted density. This Section 181 shall apply with respect to enlargements, alterations and reconstruction of the nonconforming portion of such dwelling or other housing structure, consisting of those dwelling units or other housing units which exceed the permitted density. Any dwelling unit or other housing unit coming within the density limit shall not be affected by 
this Section 181. Except as provided in Sections 181(h) and 182(e), no dwelling or other housing structure exceeding the permitted density of dwelling units or other housing units shall be altered to increase the number of dwelling units or other housing units therein, or to increase or create any other nonconformity with respect to the dwelling unit or other housing unit density limitations of Section 209.1 or Section 209.2.  
 * (d)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 181, a structure occupied by a nonconforming use that is damaged or destroyed by fire, or other calamity, or by Act of God, or by the public enemy, may be restored to its former condition and use; provided that such restoration is permitted by the Building Code, and is started within eighteen months and diligently prosecuted to completion. The age of such a structure for the purposes of Sections 184 and 185 shall nevertheless be computed from the date of the original construction of the structure. Except as provided in Subsection (e) below, no structure occupied by a nonconforming use that is voluntarily razed or required by law to be razed by the owner thereof may thereafter be restored except in full conformity with the use limitations of this Code.  
For purposes of this Subsection (d), "started within eighteen months" shall mean that within eighteen months of the fire or other calamity or Act of God, the structure's owner shall have filed a building permit application to restore the structure to its former condition and use. 
 * (e)   In order that major life safety hazards in structures may be eliminated as expeditiously as possible, a structure containing nonconforming uses and constructed of unreinforced masonry that is inconsistent with the requirements of the UMB Seismic Retrofit Ordinance, Ordinance No. 227-92, may be demolished and reconstructed with the same nonconforming use or a use as permitted by Planning Code Section 182; provided that there is no increase in any nonconformity, or any new nonconformity, with respect to the use limitations of this Code; provided further that the current requirements of the Building Code, 
the Housing Code and other applicable portions of the Municipal Code are met; and provided further that such restoration or reconstruction is started within one year after razing or other demolition work on the structure and diligently prosecuted to completion.  
 * (f)   A nighttime entertainment use within the RSD, MUG, MUR, or SLR Districts may be enlarged, intensified, extended or expanded, including the expansion to an adjacent lot or lots, provided that: (1) the enlargement, intensification, extension or expansion is approved as a conditional use pursuant to Sections 303 and 316 of this Code; (2) the use as a whole meets the parking and signage requirements, floor area ratio limit, height and bulk limit, and all other requirements of this Code which would apply if the use were a permitted one; and (3) the provisions of Section 803.5(b) of this Code are satisfied.  
 * (g)   Automotive sales and service signs within the Automotive Special Use District which have all required permits but which do not comply with the controls for new signs established in Section 607.3 of this Code shall be permitted to remain as nonconforming uses and shall be permitted to modify the signage text to describe new automobile ownerships and dealerships that may occur from time to time.  
 * (h)   In PDR Districts, no building containing a residential use shall be altered to increase the number of dwelling units or other housing units therein. However, individual dwelling units or other housing units may be expanded, subject to height, bulk, and all other provisions of this Code which would otherwise be applicable to dwelling units or other housing units in the Urban Mixed Use District.  
 * (i)   In the Eastern Neighborhoods Mixed Use, PDR-1-D, and PDR-1-G Districts, a non-residential nonconforming use may expand in gross floor area by no more than 25 percent with conditional use authorization pursuant to Section 303 of this Code. Such conditional use authorization may not be granted for any subsequent or additional expansion beyond the initial 25 percent. 
 * <u>*(j)  In the PDR-1-D, PDR-1-G, and PDR-2 Districts, a storage building for household goods shall be allowed to rebuild to its current square footage, as long as it provides at least one FAR of PDR uses, as defined in Section 401.  A Notice of Special Restriction (NSR) shall be recorded on the title of any property receiving approval under this Section. This NSR shall provide the Planning Department with the ability to enforce the provisions of this Section.*</u>
 * **SEC. 204.3.  ACCESSORY USES IN C, M, AND PDR DISTRICTS.** 
 * (a)   No use shall be permitted as an accessory use to a lawful principal or conditional use in any C-1 or C-2 District which involves or requires any of the following: 
 * (1)   The total employment for such accessory use of more than five persons in a C-1 District, or more than 10 persons in a C-2 District; 
 * (2)   The use of any single machine of more than one horsepower in a C-1 District, or more than 2&frac12; horsepower in a C-2 District; 
 * (3)   The use of machines in any one establishment in an aggregate of more than five horsepower in a C-1 District, or more than 10 horsepower in a C-2 District; 
 * (4)   The use of more than &frac14; of the total floor area occupied by such use and the principal or conditional use to which it is accessory, except in the case of accessory off-street parking or loading; or 
 * (5)   The production of goods not intended primarily for retail sale or use on the premises. 
 * (b)   No use shall be permitted as an accessory use to a lawful principal or conditional use in any C-3 District which involves or requires the use of any single machine of more than five horsepower; or the use of more than &frac14; of the total floor area occupied by such use and the principal or conditional use to which it is accessory, except in the case of accessory off-street parking and loading. These limitations shall not apply to equipment or machines pertaining integrally to the lawful principal use itself. 
 * (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 227(h) and (i) and 260(b)(2)(l) and (M) of this Code, an accessory use to a lawful principal or conditional use in any C or M District which involves or requires the installation of a tower or antenna solely for the reception of radio and television broadcasts for the exclusive benefit of the residents or occupants in the building on which the antenna is placed shall be permitted without regard to the height of such tower or antenna and without regard to the proximity of such tower or antenna to any R District. 
 * (d)   No use shall be permitted as an accessory use to a lawful principal or conditional use in any PDR District which involves or requires the use of more than one-third (1/3) of the total floor area occupied by such use and the principal or conditional use to which it is accessory, except in the case of accessory <u>*retail*</u>, off-street parking, and loading.  <u>*For accessory retail, multiple PDR uses within a single building may combine their accessory retail allotment into a single space, as long as the shared retail space is allocated proportionally to the size of each contributing PDR use, and the total allotment of accessory retail space per use does not exceed what otherwise would be permitted by this Section.*</u> 
 * *SEC. 219.1.  ALLOWANCE FOR USES TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PDR SPACE IN THE PDR-1-D AND PDR-1-G DISTRICTS.* 
 * <u>*(a)  **Purpose.** The purpose of this provision is to support the increase in the overall stock of PDR space in the City. Despite consistent and growing demand for PDR space in San Francisco, the economics of building new PDR space are very challenging, even in PDR zoning districts where these uses do not compete for land with other more economically-attractive uses. One way to make such development economically viable is to utilize the value of other non-residential space, such as office and institutional uses, to subsidize the construction of PDR space on properties that are largely vacant or substantially underutilized and that do not contain significant PDR space that would be demolished.*</u> 
 * (b)  *<u>**Geography**. This provision applies to parcels that meet all of the following criteria:*
 * *<u>(1)  Are located in either the PDR-1-D or PDR-1-G Districts;*</u> 
 * *(2)  Are located north of 20th Street;*
 * *(3)  Contain less than 0.3 gross floor area as of the date of this legislation; and*
 * *(4)  Are 20,000 square feet or larger.*
 * *(c)   **Controls.** The Planning Commission may permit, per the procedures described below in Subsection (d), non-PDR uses on the subject lot pursuant to the following provisions:* 
 * *(1)  At least 1/3 of the total gross floor area developed on the parcel shall contain PDR uses, as defined in Section 401.*
 * *(2)  For purposes of this Subsection, every square foot of Integrated PDR, as defined in Section 890.4,  or Small Enterprise Workspace, as defined in Section 227(t), shall count as 0.5 square feet of PDR space and 0.5 square feet of non-PDR space as specified in Subsection (3) below.* 
 * *(3)  The non-PDR space may contain one or both of the following uses:* 
  * *(A)  Office, as defined in Section 890.70; and/or* 
  * *(B)  Institutions, Other, as defined in Section 890.50.* 
 * *(4)  Uses other than those listed in Subsections (2) and (3) above, such as retail, are subject to the controls of the underlying district.* 
 * *(5)  No residential uses are permitted.* 
 * *(6)  The PDR space in any building must be served by:*  
  * *(A)  One or more freight elevators, for any PDR space not at street level;* 
  * *(B)  Off-street loading in accordance with Code Section 152; and* 
  * *(C)  Minimum ceiling heights of seventeen feet floor-to-floor on the ground floor, and fourteen feet floor-to-floor on the second floor and above.*  
 * *(7)  The project shall meet the Transportation Management Program requirements of Section 163(c) of the Planning Code.*  
 * *(8)  Accessory parking for uses listed in subsection (2) above may be permitted up to one space per each 1,500 square feet of occupied floor area, and all such parking shall be subject to the pricing requirements of Section 155(g).*  
 * *(9)  The first Certificate of Occupancy for the PDR portion of the development must be issued by the Department of Building Inspection before and concurrently with the first Certificate of Occupancy for the non-PDR portion of the development unless the PDR and non-PDR portions are part of a single site or building permit.*  
 * *(d)  Approvals.*
 * *(1)  All projects seeking entitlement pursuant to this Section 219.1 shall be required to receive a Conditional Use authorization, per Section 303 of the Planning Code. In evaluating a proposed authorization under this Section, the Planning Commission shall consider:*
  * *(A)  The likely viability of the new PDR space created by the development, as influenced by such factors as whether the project sponsor has developed a PDR business plan, has the commitments of established PDR tenants, and/or a demonstrated relationship with organizations established in the PDR community.*  
  * *(B)  Whether the project is an appropriate location and intensity for the proposed non-PDR use, including but not limited to whether the location of non-PDR uses would be compatible with or disruptive to PDR uses on the site and in the vicinity, recognizing that PDR uses may generate noise, vibrations, odors, trucking activity, or other PDR-related operational characteristics.*  
 * *(2)  A Notice of Special Restriction (&ldquo;NSR&rdquo;) shall be recorded on the title of any property receiving approval under this Section 291.1. Such NSR shall:* 
  * *(A)  Designate the PDR portion of parcel;* 
  * *(B)  State that the proportion of gross floor area on the site dedicated to PDR uses shall never be less than 1/3 of the total gross floor area on the parcel, including any future building or use alterations or expansions;*  
  * *(C)  Require the property owner to submit an annual report to the Planning Department, on January 31 of each year, detailing the PDR tenants on the property for the prior year their respective square footages, number of employees, contact information for each company, a description of the business or industry characteristics of each business, and the PDR space vacancy on the parcel as of the date of each report; and,* 
 * *(D)  Provide the Planning Department with the ability to enforce the provisions of this Section.</u>*
